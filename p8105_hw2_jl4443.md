# Problem 1

Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
# read in Mr. Trash Wheel dataset
trash_wheel <- read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                          sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                          range = "A2:N336") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls_int = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 1)))

# check the above
# class(pull(trash_wheel, sports_balls_int))
```

Precipitation data, 2017-2018

``` r
# read in 2017 precipitation data
precip_2017 <- read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                          sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                          range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  rename(precip = total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

# read in 2018 precipitation data
precip_2018 <- read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                          sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                          range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  rename(precip = total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

# combine the precipitation datasets 
precip_2017_2018 <- bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%

```

The trash wheel dataset records trash found in the Harbor by month and
year, from 2014-05-16 through 2018-07-28. The amount of trash is
recorded in terms of weight, volume, as well as by type of trash:
plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, grocery
bags, chip bags, and sports balls. The total amount of trash over the
study period was 934.94 tons, or 4439 cubic yards. The median number of
sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

The precipitation datasets record the amount of precipitation by month
and year. Precipitation data was recorded for 12 months in 2017 and 7
months in 2018. The average precipitaiton among months recorded across
both years was 2.97 inches (standard deviation 2.5), ranging from 0 to
9.27. The total precipitation was 32.93 in 2017 and 3.3571429 in 2018.

pols_snp_unemp <- inner_join(pols_snp, unemp, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols dataset contains information about the number of national
politicians in each of the two primary parties (democratic, republican)
by month and year (1947 - 2015). The second data source in problem two
(snp) contains the closing Standard and Poor’s (S\&P) stock market index
on the first of the month between 1950 and 2015. The third dataset of
interest (unemp) contains the percentage of unemployment by month from
1948 through 2015.

Combining these datasets among years and months that all information is
provided (political information, S\&P index, and unemployment), we have
data for 1950 - 2015. Key information contained in the combined dataset
is stored in the variables gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem,
sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president (political), close (S\&P index at market
close), and unemp\_rate (unemployment).

Over this time period, there were 354 months with a democratic president
and 427 months with a republican president. Under democratic presidents,
the S\&P closing index ranged from 17.05 to 2107.39 and unemployment
ranged from 2.7% to 10%. Whereas under republican presidents, the S\&P
closing index ranged from 23.32 to 1549.38 and unemployment ranged from
2.5% to 10.8%.
